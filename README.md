FPDI - Free PDF Document Importer
=================================

A clone of [FPDI](https://www.setasign.com/fpdi) for GitHub/[Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/setasign/fpdi).

FPDI is a collection of PHP classes facilitating developers to read pages from existing PDF documents and use them as templates in FPDF, which was developed by Olivier Plathey. Apart from a copy of FPDF, FPDI does not require any special PHP extensions.

## Installation with [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/setasign/fpdi)

FPDI is an add-on for [FPDF](http://fpdf.org/). Additionally FPDI can be used with [TCPDF](http://www.tcpdf.org/).
For completion we added a [FPDF repository](https://github.com/Setasign/FPDF) which simply clones the offical releases.

This package comes without any dependency configuration in the composer.json file. It's up to you to load the desired package as described below.
